                    This assignment definitely helped me understand the layout of a simple HTML page much better. 
                    I went step by step through the W3 site along with the "Structuring Text" page in the module while writing this code. 
                    I found that to be a huge help in understanding by breaking each step down, rather than trying to learn it all at once. 
                    I'm excited to learn more and eventually integrate CSS to spiff up my sites!
