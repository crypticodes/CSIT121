                <p>

                    The page follows a hierarchical organization, as the user must navigate categories and subcategories to find content. There is no 1 linear path to content.
                    There are sub pages that link to different topics.

                <p>

                    The site uses all 4 principles of CRAP:
                    <br>Contrast - The site uses bold colors and larger font for wording like "Donate"
                    <br>Repetition - There is consistent use of the colors red, white, and blue along the page
                    <br>Alignment - Headings and buttons are formatted neatly
                    <br>Proximity - Images and descriptions are grouped together & white space is used to separate content/topics
